# Early detection of patients at risk for chronic kidney disease among type 2 diabetes patients
Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease characterised by the inability of insulin to help introducing glucose into the body cells.  
When left untreated, complications such as diabetic foot or kidney damage may appear.  
It is estimated that in 2017 about 462 million people were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which is 6.28% of the world population.  
About 30% of patients with type 2 diabetes will experience chronic kidney disease during their lifetime, with 7% reaching a state of severe renal failure, thus requiring dialysis or transplantation.    
In this project, we examined different models to predict whether or not a patients who was diagnosed with diabities will conduct a chronic kidney disease within 2 years of initial diagnostic.  
We experienced with several different preprocessing methods, including different methods to rebalanced the data, hyperparameter optimization and performance of feature selection.
